Note that I used Database first in this development

Install NuGet packages
The following NuGet packages should be added to work with the SQL Server database and scaffolding. Run these commands in Package Manager Console:

Install-Package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design This package helps generate controllers and views.
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools This package helps create database context and a model class from the database.
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer  The database provider allows Entity Framework Core to work with SQL Server.



Scaffolding
ASP.NET Core has a feature called scaffolding, which uses T4 templates to generate code of common functionalities to help keep developers from writing repeat code. We use scaffolding to perform the following operations:

Connect application with database
To connecto to Database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Scaffold-DbContext “Server=Servername;Database=DatabaseName;User Id=ServerDBUser;Password=ServerPassword;” Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Entities 

This will generate all the Database Entities and the Context into a folder called Entities. You can use any folder of your choice.

I moved the Context file generated by the Scaffold-DBContext into a separate folder called DbContext
